# Ang-Starter
##Intro
This repository is the home for the Gikuyu Original Angular quick starter. I started this project to quickly scaffold a basic fully-MEAN project. Feel free to fork me and make your own changes!

### What Not to Expect
I'm no pro when it comes to the MEAN stack. I just do what can and can what I do. As such, not everything may be laid out in the perfect way. Feel free to refactor the folder structure to your heart's content

### What You Will Find
There a a few nice surprises in store that will allow you to get rolling pretty quickly with everything

## Features
### Aliases
Soo... as much as I love you guys for forking this repository and revisiting this page so much, the most effective way to get this stuff rockin and a rolling for development (even offline!)
Go ahead modify and include some of the aliases from the aliases.txt file to suit your needs

### Snippets
There's this AWESOME snippets file attached that I've found super helpful in the fast iteration of my projects. Some included snippets are for client side js, angular-infused html, and even pug (previously jade) html preprocessor support!

### Sass Preprocessor integration
Go ahead and globally install node-sass. It's a dependency for many of the aliases run. It's used to compile SASS (a CSS Preprocessor)
